# P690_FrontPanelPinout
Dell Precision 690 Front Panel Pinout.

These are verious files (including KiCad files) of what I had discovered during investigation. These are functional diagrams and should not be taken strictly literally (meaning I did not include various components that are all over the board, just notable ones). 

This project aims to map out the proprietary connector used by desktop Dell Precision cases so that regular motherboards can utilise it's function. The front panel board I have is from the 690. I hope this helps someone else looking for resources on using this or similar cases for their home/gaming builds.
